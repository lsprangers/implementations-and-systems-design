## Trees
### Binary Search Tree

### Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree
- Self Balancing BST's have the same property as Binary Search Tree's, except they will balance themselves out via different methods
- The reason for this balancing is that Binary Search Tree's worst case lookup time degrades to $O(n)$ if the tree represents a Linked List
  - This usually happens when we insert nodes in order and it becomes all right or left sides
