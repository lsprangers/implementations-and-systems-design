# This Repo
This entire repo is just a dump of a bunch of things I've read and wanted to write down somewhere other than a MS Word file - as many reference links as I can remember are at the bottom

## Design Systems
I forgot a lot of this since school - so

Building specific systems based utilizing [Typical Resources](#typical-resources)

Some examples include URL shortener, Youtube, Youtube Search, Top K Heavy Hitters, etc...

### Typical Resources
These are discussions and implementations of "typical" resources like distributed KV store, front end load balancer + metadata, distributed queue, etc...

## DSA
Just general Data Structures and Algorithms and their implementations, time /space complexities, and general use cases

## Other Concepts
These are generic concepts that don't fit into the other buckets - things like Embeddings, Parallel Training designs, Pregel Graph Traversals, etc...

## Implementations
This is a folder of generic implementations of things like
- "A Key Value store with transactions"
- "A balanced binary search tree from scratch"
- "ML feature store architecture diagram"

## Leet
This is just a dump of leetcode problems and comments
