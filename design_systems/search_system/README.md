# Search System (Youtube for example)
Search Systems (also Recommendation systems since we recommend something back) are used for finding relevant content based on a query

- "What day is it today"
- "Michael Jordan Dunk"
- etc...

All of these things are queries and we'd expect different content to be returned

Youtube will typically return Videos, Google will return almost any content type, and Facebook might return posts

## Inverted Indexes
[Inverted Indexes](INVERTED_INDEX.md) have been around for a long time, and they built the original search systems we think of. When you hear of "Google indexed my page" or "Google crawled my page" it is referring to a system similar to this

There's many still used today, but for the most part systems require utilizing context, user features / demographics, and many other inputs to help design Search and Recommendation Systems
